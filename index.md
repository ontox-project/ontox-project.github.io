## The ONTOX Project

[ONTOX](ONTOX%20will%20deliver%20a%20generic%20strategy%20to%20create%20innovative%20new%20approach%20methodologies%20(NAMs)%20in%20order%20to%20predict%20systemic%20repeated%20dose%20toxicity%20effects%20that,%20upon%20combination%20with%20tailored%20exposure%20assessment,%20will%20enable%20human%20risk%20assessment.%20This%20strategy%20can%20be%20applied%20to%20any%20type%20of%20chemical%20and%20systemic%20repeated%20dose%20toxicity%20effect.)
will deliver a generic strategy to create innovative new approach
methodologies (NAMs) in order to predict systemic repeated dose toxicity
effects that, upon combination with tailored exposure assessment, will
enable human risk assessment. This strategy can be applied to any type
of chemical and systemic repeated dose toxicity effect.

## Tools, Software and models

We envision to share the tools, software and models developed in ONTOX
here. Stay tuned to these pages for updates. These Github pages will
also be used to share the [documentation](/docs/docs.html).
